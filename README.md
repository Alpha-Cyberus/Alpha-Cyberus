Hi, Iâ€™m @Alpha-Cyberus!  
I'm from England but I live in Czechia. I started out studying to be a game developer but now I'm more interested in becoming a software or web developer.
This git profile is pretty new since I recently got back from several years of volunteer service, but I'll continually be adding a range of fun little side projects to build a sweet portfolio so keep an eye on this space!

Lately I've been focusing on front end web dev, learning HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, and UI/ UX design, but I also like to mess around quite often with Python and Batch scripting in my spare time just for fun.  
Previously I learned C++ and C# at university for a degree in game development and worked for a couple years doing software analysis where I used a lot of SQL. My favorite IDE is Atom, but I like Visual Studio too. My favorite game engine is Unity, but I've not used it in a very long time. I tend to use an agile methodology on my own projects but am interested in TDD.  

I'm working on a couple personal projects to keep practicing, but would love to collaborate on something interesting.  
Contact me here, on Discord (Alpha Cyberus#6157), or at LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/luffyobrien/.

Fun fact: Once I cut down a tree just by looking at it. It's true, I saw it with my own eyes!
