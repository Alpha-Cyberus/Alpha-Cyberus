Hi, Iâ€™m @Alpha-Cyberus!
I'm from England but I live in Czechia. I started out studying to be a game developer but now I'm more interested in becoming a web or software developer.
This git profile is pretty new since I recently got back from several years of volunteer service, but I'll continually be adding a range of fun little side prijects to build a sweet portfolio so keep an eye on this space!

Learning: Mainly HTML, CSS, JS, UI/ UX design, but I also like to mess around with Python and Batch scripting just for fun.
My favorite IDE is Atom, it's great!
Before focusing on expanding my web development skills I studied C++ and C# for several years with a hint of Java and .NET.

I'm working on various small personal projects to learn more, but would love to collaborate on something interesting.
Contact me here, on Discord (Alpha Cyberus#6157), or at LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/luffyobrien/.

Fun fact: Once I cut down a tree just by looking at it. It's true, I saw it with my own eyes!
