Hi, Iâ€™m @Alpha-Cyberus!
I'm from England but I live in Czechia. I started out studying to be a game developer but now I'm more interested in becoming a web developer.

Learning: HTML, CSS, JS, UI/ UX design, batch scripting, and whatever seems fun.
My favorite IDE is Atom, it's great!

I'm working on various small personal projects to learn more, but would love to collaborate on something interesting.
Contact me here or on Discord, my name is Alpha Cyberus#6157.

Fun fact: Once I cut down a tree just by looking at it. It's true, I saw it with my own eyes!
